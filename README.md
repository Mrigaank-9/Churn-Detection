# Customer Churn Prediction

The Customer Churn Prediction project aims to predict whether a customer will leave a service based on specific features. Geography shows where a customer is located, as regional differences can affect customer behavior. Gender helps account for variations in service use between male and female customers. Age is also vital, as different age groups tend to have varying levels of service loyalty and engagement. <br>

The Balance parameter reflects a customer’s financial standing, which may indicate churn risk if they are less engaged. A customer’s Credit Score gives insight into their financial responsibility, potentially influencing churn likelihood. Estimated Salary measures income level, which could impact their ability to sustain service usage. <br>

Tenure is another critical factor, representing how long the customer has been with the company, where longer tenure generally signals increased loyalty. The Number of Products a customer uses reflects their level of involvement with the company, with higher product usage indicating stronger ties. <br>

The Has Credit Card feature shows whether the customer holds a company credit card, and this can increase engagement. Lastly, Is Active Member assesses if the customer is currently active, with active users typically less likely to churn. <br>

By analyzing these features, the model can predict at-risk customers, helping businesses take steps to prevent churn and retain their customer base. <br>
